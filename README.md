# Code Refactor

## Project Description
---
code-refactor has been updated from its original format to refactor the following:
- Added ID to div for "search-engine-optimization" to correct in-page link.
- Deleted unnecessary </img> tag from self-closing cost-management.png image.
- Added alt attributes to all images.
- Consolidated CSS selectors & reorganized CSS formatting 
- Added index.html and style.css comments

---

Since this is only a refactor, the (intended) original formatting of the website has not been changed per the screenshot below:
<img src="./Develop/assets/images/horiseon_sc.png" />
